Reverse Nodes in k-Group
Hard

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

Follow up:

Could you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Example 4:

Input: head = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range sz.
1 <= sz <= 5000
0 <= Node.val <= 1000
1 <= k <= sz
